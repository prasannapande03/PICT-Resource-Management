## About the Project
1. A Resource Management tool developed for Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), designed to streamline the booking of resources such as auditoriums, seminar halls, digital display boards, labs, and classrooms, ensuring no scheduling conflicts arise.
2. This web application provides a paperless, efficient alternative to the traditional system, where students previously had to navigate through multiple authorities to gain approval.
3. The approval process is now fully automated and digitized, allowing users to easily check via a calendar if a resource is available on a particular date and time. If available, they can initiate a permission request, which automatically moves through the required authority hierarchy for approval.
4. The tool is widely used by student organizations, department branches, and faculty members to facilitate a smooth and efficient resource management experience.

### Built With
